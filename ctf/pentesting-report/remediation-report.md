# Remediation Report

The vulnerabilities found during the blackbox pentesting of `foomegahost.com` pose a significant risk to the website and its users. The following recommendations should be implemented to fix the vulnerabilities and prevent future attacks.

### LFI Vulnerability

The LFI vulnerability was discovered in the website's file upload feature. To fix this vulnerability, the following measures can be taken:

* Input validation: Implement input validation to ensure that the file upload feature only accepts valid file types and does not allow file uploads with malicious content.
* File permissions: Set appropriate file permissions to restrict access to sensitive files and directories on the server.
* Sanitize file names: Sanitize file names to prevent directory traversal attacks.

### XSS Vulnerability

The XSS vulnerability was found at various sections of the website. To fix this vulnerability, the following measures can be taken:

* Input validation: Implement input validation to prevent the injection of malicious code into web pages.
* Output encoding: Use output encoding to prevent the execution of malicious code injected into web pages.
* Use Content Security Policy (CSP): Implement a content security policy to prevent the execution of untrusted scripts on web pages.

### User Account Takeover Vulnerability

The user account takeover vulnerability was discovered in the login feature of the website. To fix this vulnerability, the following measures can be taken:

* Implement two-factor authentication: Implement two-factor authentication to prevent unauthorized access to user accounts.
* Implement account lockout: Implement account lockout to prevent brute-force attacks on user accounts.

### Admin Account Takeover Vulnerability

The admin account takeover vulnerability was found in the website's administrative panel. To fix this vulnerability, the following measures can be taken:

* Implement multi-factor authentication: Implement multi-factor authentication to prevent unauthorized access to the administrative panel.
* Use a strong password policy: Enforce a strong password policy to prevent weak passwords that can be easily guessed.

### Subdomain Enumeration

Subdomain enumeration using several tools and manual testing revealed additional subdomains: `m`, `me`, and `fmh-intranetarea`. To fix this vulnerability, the following measures can be taken:

* Remove unnecessary subdomains: Remove subdomains that are not required for the functioning of the website.
* Restrict access to sensitive subdomains: Restrict access to sensitive subdomains to prevent unauthorized access and information disclosure.

### SQL Injection Vulnerability

The website was found to be vulnerable to SQL injection. To fix this vulnerability, the following measures can be taken:

* Use parameterized queries: Implement parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks.
* Input validation: Implement input validation to ensure that user input is sanitized and does not contain malicious code.

### Anti-CSRF Token Missing

Upon examining the system, it was found that the anti-CSRF token is missing. This token is an essential security feature that helps prevent against Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks. Without it, the system is vulnerable to malicious requests that can cause harm to the user's sensitive data. In order to remedy this issue, we must first identify where the token should have been implemented and then take the necessary steps to add it back into the system. This will require careful planning and attention to detail, but it is imperative in order to ensure the safety and security of our users and their data.
